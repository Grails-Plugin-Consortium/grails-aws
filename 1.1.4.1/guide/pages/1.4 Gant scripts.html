    Grails AWS Plugin brings some scripts to use in your app, all scripts names follow this rule:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>aws&#45;&#91;service&#93;&#45;&#91;operation&#93;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>So, all scripts are prefixed with 'aws', followed by its service code, and then the operation name, almost always the same operation name in the corresponding WSDL. For example, to connect with SES and check your sending email statistics (GetSendStatistics operation), you'll have to execute:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>grails aws&#45;ses&#45;get&#45;send&#45;statistics</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>All information are printed in your screen, and when you need to interact with parameters, the script will prompt you.
