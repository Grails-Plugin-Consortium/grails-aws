To let AWS SES send e-mails using your e-mail as 'from' address, you have to authorize it.

To to so, you can run the script:

{code}
grails aws-ses-verify-email
{code}

You'll be prompted about the e-mail address to verify. After that, SWS will send an confirmation e-mail to this address, you should click on the link in that e-mail to start sending emails using this from.

You will have to do it for all emails you want to use with SES.
