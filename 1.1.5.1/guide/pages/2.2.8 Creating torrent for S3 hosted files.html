    It is possible to generate torrent URLs for S3 hosted files with the plugin.<p class="paragraph"/>After uploading some file, just call the <strong class="bold">torrent()</strong> method on it and you'll get the torrent URL for it.<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>def s3file = <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> File(<span class="java&#45;quote">"test.txt"</span>) &#123;

Data transfer via the BitTorrent protocol is metered at the same rate as client/server delivery. To be precise, whenever a downloading BitTorrent client requests a “piece” of an object from the S3 “seeder”, charges accrue just as if an anonymous request for that piece had been made using the REST or SOAP protocol. These charges will appear on your S3 bill and usage reports in the same way. <strong class="bold">The difference is that if a lot of clients are requesting the same object simultaneously via BitTorrent, then the amount of data S3 must serve to satisfy those clients will be lower than with client/server delivery</strong>. This is because the BitTorrent clients are simultaneously uploading and downloading amongst themselves. The data transfer savings achieved from use of BitTorrent can vary widely depending on how popular your object is. Less popular objects require heavier use of the “seeder” to serve clients, and thus the difference between BitTorrent distribution costs and client/server distribution costs may be small for such objects. In particular, if only one client is ever downloading a particular object at a time, the cost of BitTorrent delivery will be the same as direct download.</em>
