    The plugin adds support for uploading files to Amazon S3, by adding a s3upload(...) method to <strong class="bold">File</strong> and <strong class="bold">InputStream</strong> classes, so you'll just need to call this method passing a closure with overridden config options, but if you do not want to override it, just leave this and the plugin will catch from the Config.groovy default options.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Simple File upload from a File object</h3><p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>def s3file = <span class="java&#45;keyword">new</span> File(<span class="java&#45;quote">"/tmp/test.txt"</span>).s3upload &#123;
    path <span class="java&#45;quote">"folder/to/my/file/"</span>
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>This way your test.txt file will be uploaded to<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>&#60;<span class="java&#45;keyword">default</span>&#45;bucket&#62;.s3.amazonaws.com/folder/to/my/file/test.txt</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>If you want to override config during the file upload, check this guide next section.<p class="paragraph"/><h3>Uploading files directly from its InputStream</h3><p class="paragraph"/>This is useful when you don't have the file stored in your filesystem. When user uploads files to your application using a <strong class="bold">multipart/form-data</strong> form, you can upload it directly to s3. Imagine it have an upload form like this:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>&#60;g:uploadForm action=<span class="java&#45;quote">"uploadFromInputStream"</span>&#62;
    &#60;input type=<span class="java&#45;quote">"file"</span> name=<span class="java&#45;quote">"photo"</span>&#62;
    &#60;input type=<span class="java&#45;quote">"submit"</span> value=<span class="java&#45;quote">"upload"</span>&#62;
&#60;/g:uploadForm&#62;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>you could have your <strong class="bold">uploadFromInputStream</strong> action implemented this way:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>def file = request.getFile('photo')
def uploadedFile = file.inputStream.s3upload(file.originalFilename) &#123;
    bucket <span class="java&#45;quote">"file&#45;upload&#45;from&#45;inputstream"</span>
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/><blockquote class="warning">
Uploading from InputStream requires one extra parameters, the filename that this object will have in S3, usually the 'originalFileName'.
</blockquote><p class="paragraph"/>Note that when you use <strong class="bold">File</strong>.s3upload you just pass the closure that configures it. When using from one inputStream, you <strong class="bold">SHOULD</strong> have to specify the name that file will have and the file size. The above example show exactly how to do it with the correct info from the uploaded file.
