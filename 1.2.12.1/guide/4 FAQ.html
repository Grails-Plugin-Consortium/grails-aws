    <h1><a name="4 FAQ">4 FAQ</a></h1><strong class="bold">Q) Why not use amazon-s3 plugin?</strong><p class="paragraph"/>A) Because it is not under massive development anymore, because it depends on quartz plugin, and because I found some itchy bugs on it that really annoys me on my other project using it.<p class="paragraph"/>
<strong class="bold">Q) Why you donâ€™t submit a patch to it?</strong><p class="paragraph"/>A) Because it is not under massive development anymore (again), and because the idea on this grails-aws plugin, as I said before, is to offer an easier way to use AWS service, and not only S3.<p class="paragraph"/>
<strong class="bold">Q) I have some aws code that I'm using here, can I attach it on this plugin and send a pull request?</strong><p class="paragraph"/>A) For sure, I'd be thankful if you are willing to do so, but remember the main reason we're developing this plugin, to provide <strong class="bold">EASY</strong> access to AWS functionalities.<p class="paragraph"/><strong class="bold">Q) Can I use this plugin to send e-mails using my current SMTP infrastructure?</strong><p class="paragraph"/>A) Unfortunately, SES does not provide a simple SMTP server address to connect and use, otherwise we could just configure the Grails Mail Plugin to use it. Instead of this, AWS provides a http web service for it.<p class="paragraph"/><strong class="bold">Q) Can I use the Grails Mail plugin to connect to Amazon SES Email service?</strong><p class="paragraph"/>A) As described above, SES does not offer you a SMTP address, if you want to use Mail Plugin, you have two options to do.
<ul class="star">
<li><strong class="bold">#1</strong> You can configure AWS SES with a SMTP Bridge to connect to your SMTP server, but only if you're running Postfix or Sendmail locally. There is a great post that shows how to do this: <a href="http://netwiser.blogspot.com/2011/02/setup-amazon-ses-to-relay-email-by.html" target="blank">http://netwiser.blogspot.com/2011/02/setup-amazon-ses-to-relay-email-by.html</a></li>
<li><strong class="bold">#2</strong> You can configure mail plugin to use the ses protocol as described here <a href="http://roshandawrani.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/grails-using-mail-plugin-with-amazon-email-service/" target="blank">http://roshandawrani.wordpress.com/2011/04/06/grails-using-mail-plugin-with-amazon-email-service/</a></li>
